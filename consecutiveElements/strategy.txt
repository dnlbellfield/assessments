Strategy: 
Create mostConsecutiveOccurrences and set it to 0.
Create mostConsecutiveElements and set it to an empty container. 
For each element in the array: 
  Create currentElementOccurrences and set it to 1.
  While the current element is equal to the next element:
    Increase currentElementOccurrences by 1.
    Move the next element position over one spot to the right.
  If currentElementOccurrences is equal to mostConsecutiveOccurrences
  And mostConsecutiveElements does not contain the current element:
    Add the current element to mostConsecutiveElements.
  If currentElementOccurrences is greater than mostConsecutiveOccurrences:
    Set mostConsecutiveOccurrences to currentElementOccurrences.
    Set mostConsecutiveElements to the current element. 
Return mostConsecutiveElements and mostConsecutiveOccurrences. 

strategy:
Create greatestConsecutiveOccurrence and set it to 0.
Create greatestConsecutiveElements and set it to an empty list.
For each element in the array:
  Set the current element occurrence count to 1.
  If the next element is equal to the current element:
    Increase the current element occurrence by 1.
    Set next element to the element after next element.
  If the current element occurrence is equal to greatestConsecutiveOccurrence
  And the current element is not in greatestConsecutiveElements:
    Add currentElement to greatestConsecutiveElements.
    If the current element occurrence is greater than greatestConsecutiveOccurrence:
      Set mostConsecutiveOccurrences to currentElementOccurrences.
      Set mostConsecutiveElements to the current element. 
Return mostConsecutiveElements and mostConsecutiveOccurrences.
