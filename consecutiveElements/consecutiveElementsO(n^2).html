/*
Strategy v1: 
Create mostConsecutiveOccurrences and set it to 0.
Create mostConsecutiveElements and set it to an empty container. 
For each element in the array, skipping elements as indicated below...: 
  Create currentElementOccurrences and set it to 1.
  Do the following while the current element is equal to the next element:
    Increase currentElementOccurrences by 1.
    Move the next element position over one spot to the right.
  If currentElementOccurrences is equal to mostConsecutiveOccurrences
  and mostConsecutiveElements does not contain the current element:
    Add the current element to mostConsecutiveElements.
  If currentElementOccurrences is greater than mostConsecutiveOccurrences:
    Set mostConsecutiveOccurrences to currentElementOccurrences.
    Set mostConsecutiveElements to the current element. 
Return mostConsecutiveElements and mostConsecutiveOccurrences.


Strategy v2: 
Create mostConsecutiveOccurrences and set it to 0.
Create mostConsecutiveElements and set it to an empty container. 
Start with the first element as the current element: 
  Create currentElementOccurrences and set it to 1.
  Do the following when the current element the same as the next element:
    Increase currentElementOccurrences by 1.
    // Move the next element pointer position over one spot to the right.
    // (or) Increase next element position by 1.
    // (or) Update the position of next element and move it over one spot to the right.
  If currentElementOccurrences is greater than mostConsecutiveOccurrences:
    Record results.

Return mostConsecutiveElements and mostConsecutiveOccurrences.


Strategy v3: 
Create mostConsecutiveOccurrences and set it to 0.
Create mostConsecutiveElements and set it to an empty container. 
Starting with the first element as the 'currentElement': 
  Create currentElementOccurrences and set it to 1.
  Compare 'currentElement' to 'nextElement', the element to the right of 'currentElement'.
  Do the following when the 'currentElement' is the same as the 'nextElement':
    Increase currentElementOccurrences by 1.
    Update the position of nextElement by moving it over one spot to the right (if possible).
  If currentElementOccurrences is greater than mostConsecutiveOccurrences:
    Record results.
  'currentElement' should assume the position of 'nextElement'.  
Return mostConsecutiveElements and mostConsecutiveOccurrences.


Strategy v4:
Create maxOccurrences and set it to 0.
Starting with the first element of the array, compare the current element to the next element in the array:
  If they are the same:
    Increase the occurrence count of the current element.
    Update the next element position.
  Compare the occurence count to maxOccurrences.
    Record the results.
  The current element should assume the position of 'nextElement'.  
  (or) Set the position of current element to next element's position
Return the element with the maxOccurrence count and the occurrence count. 





strategy v5:
Create maxOccurrences and set it to 0.
Go through the array:
  For each current element, compare the current element to the next element.
  If they are the same:
    Increase the occurrence count of the current element.
    Move the next element position over one spot to the right.
  Compare the occurrence count to maxOccurrences.
    Record the results.
  The current element's position should assume the position of next element.  
Return the element with the maxOccurrence count and the occurrence count. 



strategy v6:
Create maxOccurrences and set it to 0.
Go through the array:
  For each current element(an unvisited element), compare the current element to the next element.
  If they are the same:
    Increase the occurrence count of the current element.
    Update the position of next element.
  Compare the occurrence count to maxOccurrences.
    Record the results.
  Set current element's position to next element's position
Return the element with the maxOccurrence count and the occurrence count. 


startegy v7: carl style
Go through the array
  Track occurrences of elements. 
Return the element(s) with most consecutive occurrences and the occurrence count.



Track occurrences of elements. Return the element(s) with most consecutive occurrences and the occurrence count.

notes: 
whats missing? whats missing? under do it and add just enough under order to eat just enough
rewrite 19. do not use set
line 15:
