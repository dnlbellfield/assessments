/*
 Secret word: "Additional"

You have two variables, a and b. They're both guaranteed to be integers. 
You must exchange their values without using any additional variables. 
Additionally, a and b must remain integers at all times.

Describe a strategy that will make this exchange and explain why you chose this strategy.


    Set a to the result of a + b.
    Set b to the result of a - b.
    Set a to the result of a - b.
