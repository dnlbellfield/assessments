DISCUSSION
==========

Given all of the constraints of the problem, you must
quickly realize that the main knob is your choice of
mathematical operator. 

Strategically, if you start from the simplest ones
(addition and subtraction) you’ll quickly get your first
working answer.

If you continue to turn the knob and try multiplication
and division, you see that it’s more complicated because
you have to special case the situation where you might
divide by 0.

SUMMARY
=======

Add and subtract

================
TOP-DOWN OUTLINE
================

// Store both numbers in a.
Set a to a + b.

// Set b to a’s original value.
Set b to a - b.

// Set a to b’s original value.
Set a to a - b.

====================
PROOF OF CORRECTNESS
====================

Assume a = i, where i is an integer.
Assume b = j, where j is an integer.

After the first step, “Set a to a + b”,
a = i + j

After the second step, “Set b to a - b”,
b = (i + j) - j
b = i 

After the third step, “Set a to a - b”,
a = (i + j) - i
a = j

* It works!
* Not realistic I guess?
