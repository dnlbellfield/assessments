In this problem, simpler is better. The simplest
solution I am aware of uses division, addition, and
subtraction. Some students wanted to work with
decimals. The problem is that decimals must be rounded
to a whole number before they can be used. Thus, the
decimal becomes an intermediate "waste" product.

SUMMARY
=======

Handle even and odd lengths separately.

TOP-DOWN OUTLINE
================

If array.length is odd:
  // Return middle number.
  middleIndex = (array.length - 1) / 2
  return array[middleIndex]
  
If array.length is even:
  // Return average of middle pair.
  middleLeftIndex = (array.length / 2) - 1
  middleRightIndex = middleLeftIndex + 1
  return (array[middleLeftIndex] + array[middleRightIndex]) / 2

PROS/CONS
=========

+ Uses simple arithmetic (/ and +).
+ Clearly separates two major cases.
