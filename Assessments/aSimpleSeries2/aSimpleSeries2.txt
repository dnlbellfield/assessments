Summary

Build up sum one term at a time

Outline 
// Establish a sum of 0 and initialize currentTerm to 1. 
Create totalSum and set it to 0.
Create currentTerm and set it to 1.

Create term and set it to 1.
// Compute totalSum of the first n terms.
n times:
  Add currentTerm to totalSum.
  Add 2 to currentTerm.

Return totalSum.

Outline pros and cons
pro: easy to follow outline 
con: longer than the formula strategy

Summary

Square n (multiply n by itself) 

Outline
// Multiply n by itself to compute the sum of the first n terms.
Return n * n

Pros:
You can solve this problem directly using a formula, n * n.
