Mental cues for top-down outlines
A component can be a set of lines, a single line, or part of a line. For every component in your description, consider the following:

Mental cues for structure:

Is it at the right level? (child, sibling, parent)
Is it part of a broader goal?
Mental cues for correctness:

Is it unambiguous?
Is it true?
Is it possible?
Taken together, do all the steps always lead to a correct result for all valid inputs?
Mental cues for clarity:

Is it necessary to get a correct result? If not, could we delete it?
Is it expressed in the simplest way possible?
