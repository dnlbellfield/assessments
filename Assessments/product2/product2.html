  Do NOT reply until you've thought through every angle. 
  Keep in mind that you are on a reduced code review schedule. 
  I'm limiting you to as little as 1/week until I see you put more care into your work.
  I have to repeat this question because you refused to answer it and instead went on a series of unrelated tangents. 
  What are the issues with the following? 

  x times:
    x = x / divisor

Daniel (INSERT_DATE)
Issues:
1. I am using one variable 'x' to represent two different pieces of data. 
  'x' is being used to represent a number of iterations and 'x' is also being used to store the results of (x / divisor). 
  This is an issue because: 
    a. 'x'  should be used to represent a specific number of iterations. Changing / reassigning "x's" value to something other than its intended value leads to unwanted results.
    b. Saying 'x times:' is not truthful because "x's" value / the number of iterations can be altered by "x = x / divisor".

2. It is confusing. It can be written much clearer. Here I am trying to reuse 'x' instead of creating a new variable to store the results of (x / divisor). 
Reusing 'x' makes the outline harder to read / understand. Seeing a lot of "x's" on the page is confusing.

Notes: 
How the state of 'x' changes ( unwanted behavior)
1. original state - x's original value is used to represent the number of times to iterate.
2. reassigned - x's original value changes. 'x' is now used to store the result of x / divisor.

Summary: 

Deconstruct x one division at a time.

Outline:

Create divisor and set it to 1.
// divide x by all whole numbers from 1 to x.  
x times:
  Create result and set it to x / divisor.
  // check if the updated value of result === 1.
  If result === 1:
    // 'n' exists, when result === 1, n === divisor.
    return true.
  Increase divisor by 1.  
return false.

Create divisor and set it to 1.
// divide x by all whole numbers from 1 to x.

Create divisor and set it to 1.
3 times: 
  On the second iteration: 
  Create result and set it to x / divisor.
  result = 3 / 1 
  result = 3
  check if result is equal to 1.
  3 is not equal to 1. Increase divisor by 1. Divisor is now 2.
  
  On the second iteration: 
  Create result and set it to x / divisor.
  result = 3 / 2 
  result = 1.5
  check if result is equal to 1.
  1.5 is not equal to 1. Increase divisor by 1. Divisor is now 3.

  On the third and final iteration: 
  Create result and set it to x / divisor.
  result = 3 / 3 
  result = 1
  check if result is equal to 1.
  1 is equal to 1. 
  // 'n' exists, when result === 1, n === divisor.
    return true.
