Gordon asked Kevin questions about his update.
Gordon asked Kevin to capture the downsides of his update.
- kevin said: verbose, takes time to read

Tamara said: repetitive, not overly wordy, seeing same words
over and over.

Gordon's criticism: 
with too much detail things begin to lose meaning. 
give steps meaning, too much detail we 
force people to do extra work, create a new failure point
If you have many steps, can you encapsulate them / organize them
