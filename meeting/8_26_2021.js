/*
You have an integer, j.
You have an array whose length is at least j + 1.
And you want to exchange the value of:
j
array[j]


summary ideas:

store one value seperately

Use a third container to exchange j and array[j]
aka create one new value / store one value / seperately 

summary:
store one value seperately

computational outline:
Create temporaryArrayJ and set it to array[j].
Set array[j] to j.
Set j to temporaryArrayJ. 







Thursday 8 _26 meeting ending notes:

if not ascending
  swap





Friday 8 _77 notes:

important to be good at writing
clarity and precision / pulling problems apart


------top down design------
the more indented, the more detailed

highest level: is this list ascending?
lowest level: implementation

is array in ascending order?

Check if ascending 

if not ascending:
  do something 
if ascending: 
  do nothing
